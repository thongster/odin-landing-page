# odin-landing-page
Project: Landing Page from The Odin Project Foundations

This is a practice to match a given layout from scratch, using html, css, and particularly flex layout principles.

Using what I know about flex, flex direction, justify content, align items, and layout of divs, I was able to recreate the given layout on this project.
